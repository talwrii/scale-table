A table of various scales and their relationships and means to generate them.

## Motivation
I learned to play the guitar by learning intervals rather than scales. This probably have some benefits - notes are kind of arbitrary can can get in the way - but notes are interesting too, so I am learning these.

With this in mind, I am going to improvish on the guitar while paying attention to scales on a chart. This is code to build this chart (because I am too lazy to do it manually in a spreadsheet).

Of course, formalized learning through learning pieces and exercises probably has some benefits... but I'm still probably not going to do it.

## The table
There is a [PDF version](scale.pdf) and a [png version](scale.png)

## Usage
You can copy this table and print it. If you want to regenerate you can:

* clone this repo
* Create a venv with `python -m venv env`
* Install requirements iwth `env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Regenerates `scale.pdf` with `env/bin/python scale..py`
* Convert this into a PNG with imagemagick and `convert scale.pdf scale.png`
